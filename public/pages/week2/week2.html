            <p>
              While working with functions in JavaScript there is one important
              feature we should remember about - callbacks. Callbacks allow us
              to pass one function as the parameter in the other function.

              <code>
                function doActionWithSomone(anyFunctionRefrence, name) {
                (anyFunctionRefrence(name)); }
              </code>

              Node Package Manager - mostly known as NPM. It's purpose is to put
              packages in the place, so node can find them and manages
              dependencies. To install node modules we just need one command in
              the terminal
              <br />
              <code> npm install </code>
              <br />
              This way we have installed node modules into our project. What we
              can also do it install dependencies such as express, nodemon or
              bootstrap. We just simply need to type:
              <br />
              <code> npm install express </code>
              <br />
              Another way to install dependencies is by specifying them in the
              package.json file.
              <br />
              <code> "dependencies": { "express": "^4.17.3" } </code>
              <br />
              To implement imports such as express in our app.js file we have
              two options:
              <br />
              1. The newer one is using import:
              <br />
              <code> import express from 'express'; </code>
              <br />
              2. The other one is using require:
              <br />
              <code> const express = require('express'); </code>
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row align-items-start">
        <div class="col">
        <h2>PACKAGE.JSON</h2>
        <div class="col__content">
            <p class="package__info">
            Package.Json is a core element of the NODE.JS, that contains important metadata about a project and also defines functional attributes of a project that npm uses to for example install dependencies or run scripts.
            When publishing the project for example to github, we do not include node.modules package. Thanks to package.json, a person who clones our project can 
            just type 
            <br>
            <code>
              npm install 
            </code>
            <br>
            And all the dependencies will be installed along with node.modules folder.
