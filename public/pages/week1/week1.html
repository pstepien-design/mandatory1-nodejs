              NodeJS is a run time environment that allows to run javascript
              outside of the browser. It utilises V8 engine created by Google.
              NodeJS allows for server-side scripting, which is running the
              script before the website is send to the web browser.

          <h2>HOW TO START</h2>
          <div class="col__content">
            <p>
              To initialize NodeJS project we need to install NodeJS on our
              computer, along with the NPM. NPM stands for Node Package Manager
              and allows us to install and modify packages inside of our
              project.
              <br />
              After installing both things, we can create a folder in which we
              will place our project. Then we just need to type
              <code>npm init</code> to initialize the project. Then we will be
              asked to fill out the information about the package name, version,
              description, entry point(which is our main java script file like
              app.js), test, git repository, keywords, author and license we
              want to utilise. Then we need to confirm the details we provided
              and we are done with project initialization!
              <br />
              To work easily with the code, we can go to the terminal and move
              to our project's directory. Then by typing code . we can open our
              file in VS Code compilator (this feature needs to be installed
              first in out vs code).

            <h5>FUNCTIONS</h5>
            <p>
              In Java Script we have two different types of fucntions: normal
              function and arrow function.
              <br />
              Normal function is declared by the function keyword, follow by the
              name parantheses and curly brackets
              <br />
              <code> function myFunction() { ... } </code>
              <br />
              Arrow function is a bit different. It is assigned to a variable.
              <br />
              <code> const myfunction = () => { .. } </code>
            </p>
            <h5>VARIABLES</h5>
            <p>
              In JavaScript objects look similar to json objects
              <br />
              <code> const meme = { points: 54234, }; </code>
              <br>
              We can access object's variable or add a new one by just refering
              to the object's name, dot and variable name
              <br />
              <code> meme.points += 1; meme.age = 'old'; </code>
            </p>

          <h2>REST API</h2>
          <div class="col__content">
            <p>
              While creating APIs, which are protocols for building and integrating software, we can utilise the rules of REST. Request are managed through HTTP requests such as: 
              <h5> POST </h5>
              <p>To add a new item </p>
              <h5> DELETE </h5>
              <p>To delete an item </p>
              <h5> GET </h5>
              <p>To get an item/ a list of items </p>
              <h5> PATCH </h5>
              <p>Updating only some details about the item </p>
              <h5> PUT </h5>
              <p>Updating all the details about the item </p>
            </p>
          </div>
