            <p>
              We got used to working with loops, when we want to for example get
              the value of every object in the array. However, the typical,
              "old-school" loop takes lots of lines of code:
              <br />
              Let's say we have an array of numbers:
              <br />
              <code> const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]; </code>
              <br />
              If we want to increment each value of the array, the loop would
              look like this.
              <br />
              <code> for(let number of numbers){ number += 1; } </code>

              <br />
              There is a faster solution. We can use forEach method.
              <br />
              <code> numbers.forEach(number => number++); </code>
              <br />
              However, forEach has one limitation - it does not return anything,
              it can only iterate. If we want to return a value, the better
              solution is to use .map function.
              <br />
              <code> numbers.map(number => { number++ return number; }); </code>
            </p>

          <h2>EXPRESS -> BACKEND SERVER</h2>
          <div class="col__content">
            <p>
              As it was mentioned before we can utilise express in node. Express
              allows us to process different http requests on our server.
              <br />
              First we need to import express, after that we need to specify our
              application will use it. Then we just need to write app. followed
              by the desired request.
              <br />
              <code>
                const express = require('express');
                <br />
                const app = express();
                <br />
                app.get('/', (req, res) => { res.send('getting') });
                <br />
                app.post('/', (req, res) => { res.send('posting') });
              </code>
              <br />
              To be able to access the server we need to specify the port it
              will work on. We utilise app.listen for this.
              <br />
              <code>
                app.listen(8080, () => { console.log('The server is running',
                8080); });
              </code>
              <br>
              If we want to work with different files in our project structure, we should utilise express.static
              By doing this, we specify the directory of the files to serve.
              <br>
              <code>
                app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
              </code>
              <br>
              __dirname is a variable that is used to determine the absolute path of the file.
