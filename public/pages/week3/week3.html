              We got used to working with loops, when we want to for example get
              the value of every object in the array. However, the typical,
              "old-school" loop takes lots of lines of code:
              <br />
              Let's say we have an array of numbers:
              <br />
              <code> const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]; </code>
              <br />
              If we want to increment each value of the array, the loop would
              look like this.
              <br />
              <code> for(let number of numbers){ number += 1; } </code>

              <br />
              There is a faster solution. We can use forEach method.
              <br />
              <code> numbers.forEach(number => number++); </code>
              <br />
              However, forEach has one limitation - it does not return anything,
              it can only iterate. If we want to return a value, the better
              solution is to use .map function.
              <br />
              <code> numbers.map(number => { number++ return number; }); </code>
            </p>

              Node Package Manager - mostly known as NPM. It's purpose is to put
              packages in the place, so node can find them and manages
              dependencies. To install node modules we just need one command in
              the terminal
              <br />
              <code> npm install </code>
              <br />
              This way we have installed node modules into our project. What we
              can also do it install dependencies such as express, nodemon or
              bootstrap. We just simply need to type:
              <br />
              <code> npm install express </code>
              <br />
              Another way to install dependencies is by specifying them in the
              package.json file.
              <br />
              <code> "dependencies": { "express": "^4.17.3" } </code>
              <br />
              To implement imports such as express in our app.js file we have
              two options:
              <br />
              1. The newer one is using import:
              <br />
              <code> import express from 'express'; </code>
              <br />
              2. The other one is using require:
              <br />
              <code> const express = require('express'); </code>
            </p>
          </div>
