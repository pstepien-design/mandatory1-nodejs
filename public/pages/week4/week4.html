            As I mentioned before, to work with the files it is important to specify the path by __dirname or express.static
            Thanks to that node.js knows where the file is located and we can utilise it. Let's say we have a folder public. Inside of the public folder we have file with pages. In pages we can find a folder of each page. The structure looks like this
         <br>
         <pre>
          |--public
          |
          |--pages
              |
              |--homepages
                    |
                    |--homepage.html
                    |--homepage.css
                    |--homepage.js
         </pre>
         <br>
         Thanks to the static path we are capable of accessing those files for example to specify stylesheet in out html file.
         <br>
         <code>
           < link rel="stylesheet" href="/pages/homepage/homepage.css" />
         </code>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h2>SSR</h2>
        <div class="col__content">
          <p>
           SSR stands for Server Side Rendering. Instead of rendering the page on the client's side, SSR takes different approach. Page is render whenever the request is being send. Thanks ot that the performance is higher, user doesn't have to wait 
           for JavaScript to load, thus the waiting time is shorter and page loads almost instantly.
           <br>
           To acheive that we can use filesync, to get the content of our html files instantly.
           <code>
            const fs = require('fs');
            <br>
            const homepage = fs
              .readFileSync('./public/pages/homepage/homepage.html')
              .toString();
           </code>
           <br>
           By specifying the file and converting it into string, we can quickly send in our request the page in a form of string, instead of the whole html file, which makes the rendering much faster.
           <br>
           <code> 
            app.get('/', (req, res) => {
              res.send(homePage);
            });
           </code>
          </p>
